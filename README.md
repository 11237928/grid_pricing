# Smart grid pricing by reinforcement learning
This is a machine learning project for determining pricing in smart grid systems through reinforcement learning. The model and concept is taken from "A dynamic pricing response algorithm for smart grid: Reinforcement learning approach" by Renzhi Lu, Seung Ho Hong, Xiongfeng Zhang. The code is aimed at testing a reinforcement learning environment to reproduce the results of the paper.
